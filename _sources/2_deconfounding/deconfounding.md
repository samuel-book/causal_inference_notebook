# Deconfounding

Here are the main deconfounding techniques used in research and analysis:

## Statistical Methods

**Randomization**: Randomly assign subjects to treatment groups to ensure equal distribution of known and unknown confounding variables[2][5].

**Restriction**: Limit study participants to those with similar values of potential confounding variables, eliminating variation in confounders[2][5].

**Matching**: Pair subjects in treatment groups with counterparts in comparison groups who share the same confounding variable values[2][5].

**Statistical Control**: Include potential confounders as variables in regression analysis[2].

## Advanced Techniques

**Stratification**: Distribute confounders evenly within separate strata or groups for analysis[8].

**Multivariate Modeling**: Use statistical models to handle multiple covariates and confounders simultaneously[9].

**Standardization**: Use a standard reference population to negate the effects of confounding factors like age and sex[10].

## Modern Approaches

**Latent Variable Inference**: Use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to infer unobserved confounders from historical data[16].

**Variational Autoencoder Deconfounding**: Remove latent features correlated with confounders using specialized neural network architectures[7].

**Propensity Score Methods**: Estimate the probability of receiving treatment based on subject characteristics using logistic regression models[15].
